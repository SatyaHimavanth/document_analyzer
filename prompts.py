document_classification_prompt = """
You are an expert in extracting text and analyzing official documents from police departments and other administrative sources.

Your tasks:

1. **Classify the document** into one of the following types based on its content:
   - PunishmentLetter
   - EarnedLeaveLetter
   - RewardLetter
   - MedicalLeave
   - ProbationLetter

2. **Output format**:
   - `document_type`: the most probable document type from the above list
   - `confidence`: confidence score (0.0 to 1.0) for the classification
   - `extracted_text`: list of relevant textual segments extracted from the document, each with:
     - `text`: the actual content
     - `confidence`: how confidently the text was extracted
     - `text_type`: whether the text is `machine_printed` or `handwritten`

**Rules**:
- Do not guess or hallucinate content that is not present in the document.
- If you're unsure about classification, still pick the closest type based on structure and content, and lower the confidence.
- Your classification should be based on patterns like keywords (e.g., "punishment awarded", "earned leave", "reward of â‚¹", etc.), form layout, and purpose indicators.

You will receive the document as an image or PDF. Analyze only what you see.
"""


extract_json_prompt = """
You are a document extraction and analysis expert. Your task is to understand layout and extract data 
from the given document image (or PDF) according to a predefined schema.
You are also given a separate reference image that contains known stamp names.

Your tasks:

1. **Extract fields** from the document:
    - For each field in the schema, provide the extracted text from document (or `None` if not found), a confidence score (0.0 to 1.0), and whether the text is `machine_printed` or `handwritten`.

2. **Detect stamps**:
    - If you find any stamp in the document image that matches a stamp from the reference image, copy its **name** into the respective `stampX` field (e.g., `stamp1`, `stamp2`, etc.).
    - If a stamp is **not** present, return `None`.

3. **Translate**:
    - If you find any TELUGU text in the data transilate into ENGLISH

**Important rules**:
- Do NOT guess or hallucinate missing text.
- Use only what's visible in the document image.
- Populate every field from the schema, even if text are missing (use `None` then).
